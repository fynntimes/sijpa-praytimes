# SIJPA PrayTimes
Provides a simple short code, `[sijpa_ptimes for="..."]`, that shows the Ja'fari-computed prayer times 
(using calculation specifications set forth by Leva Research Institute, Qom, Iran) for each time of day.
It works by using [PrayTime.info](http://praytime.info)'s helpful API.

To use, first go to the sijpa-praytimes.php and on the top, set your timezone, latitude, and lognitude. Then,
install the plugin on your site. You can use the shortcode (shown above), but you should fill in the `for` argument
with the time of day you want to show prayer times for. These are the spellings you should use: *Imsaak, Fajr, Sunrise,
 Dhuhr, Asr, Sunset, Maghrib, Isha*.
